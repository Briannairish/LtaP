By learning more, you are better prepared to ask good science questions and to teach those around you what you have learned. 
 The more you learn, the more you can apply your science knowledge in many ways. I look forward to hearing what you have learned. Please feel free to share with me or your teacher what you have learned too. Scientists, love to learn new things too. This is what makes for good science.
