Regarding other questions above:
1) I selected the topics most closely related to my work, but I would be completely happy writing to someone who is interested in ANY of the topics listed. I can relate all of those to my work experience or interests in some way.

2) Regarding whether I would like to write to the same pen pal again or not, I feel personally neutral about this. Either option works for me.",Yes!,2017-07-14 17:49:11,public,,,67.166.159.116,1,1
